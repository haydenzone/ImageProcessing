        Gaussian Smoothing
        Dealing with edges - wrapping around (inten function) - implemented for:
            Gaussian smoothing
            Min filter
            Max filter
            Median Filter
            Range filter
            Std filter
            Kirsch Magnitude/Direction
            Laplacian

Potential bugs:
    - Gaussian smoothing takes a long time. Can be sped up using seperability.
    - Kirsch Operators run within 20 seconds, but the program has a tendancy to (not responding)
